# ACC-Python-Final
My final project for Albany Can Code's Summer 2020 session of Python For Data Analytics. In this, I used a tool to scrape former President Trump's twitter feed to see what hours of the day he tweeted the most during his time in office, from his inauguration until September 2020.

Shortly after finalizing my project for our program's final, Twitter had an update which rendered one of the tool's I used (GetOldTweets3) unable to work- so I can't add to this project or do much more with it until I find a different way to scrape tweets and data. I'm including the CSV's I made from the GOT data scrape and the data obtained from it, but new ones will not be able to be made until GOT is either updated, or a different tool can be found.
